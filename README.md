# MapsJS-WindyCams

v0.1 5/2/2022 - first

v0.2 9/5/2022 - Maps API update fix, variable names corrected

-----------------------------------------

This project combines the Google Maps Javascript API with the Windy webcam API.

Windy is a provider of meteorological data and also has a massive repository of live webcams, the largest in the world.

You'll need your own Google Maps API key for detailed maps, but it will still work without one and show you Google Maps with a developer mode watermark. Fully functional, just clone and open it locally, VS Live Server, etc.

To see a hosted version of this in action with detailed Google Maps, go to https://adeels.ca/wow
